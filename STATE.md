# STATE.md — where PE.AI is right now

_Updated 2026-10-26. Overwrite in place at every handoff._

## Status
Tier A + Tier B are **live in production** at pe-ai.vercel.app
(`main` @ acf2a29, PR #3 merged 2026-10-26). Verified on production after the
deploy: manifest + sw.js served, generation streams progressively (first item
4 s, done 9 s), `/w/<id>` renders, bad ids 404.

## What Tier B changed
- **Haiku 5.5, streamed.** `generate-workout` asks for JSON Lines and forwards
  each item as NDJSON; the browser renders progressively. Measured locally:
  first item 2–4 s, complete 8–10 s (was a 12–16 s spinner). Thinking disabled.
- **Persisted workouts + share link.** New table `workouts` (migration
  `20261027000004_workouts`, applied to `btdfzxcrbmcynpnrhzzz`). After a
  generation the URL becomes `/w/<id>`; that page is server-rendered from the
  table and offers Go mode, share, print, review, and "Make my own" back to the
  class (`/?code=XXXXXX` auto-joins).
- **Go mode** (`components/GoMode.tsx`, steps built by `lib/go-mode.ts`):
  full-screen step player, countdowns for timed work and rest, tap-to-finish
  rep sets, pause, back, chime + vibration, screen wake lock, finish screen
  that lands on the review card.
- **PWA**: `app/manifest.ts`, icons in `public/icons/` (rendered from Barlow
  Condensed by a scratch PIL script), `public/sw.js` (cache hashed assets,
  network-first pages), registered in production only.
- **Refactor**: UI primitives moved to `components/ui.tsx`, workout view to
  `components/WorkoutScreen.tsx`; `app/page.tsx` shrank from 984 to ~640 lines.

## Verified locally (dev server against the live API + DB)
tsc / lint / build clean; lib assertions for the stream parser and step
builder; NDJSON stream via curl (progressive); browser at 375px: streaming
render, URL rewrite, Go mode (timed, reps, rest), reload of `/w/<id>`,
auto-join from the share page, review submit from the share page; manifest
and sw.js served; 404 for bad ids.

## Not verified yet
- Real phone: install to home screen, wake lock, vibration/chime, share sheet.
- Keep-alive cron first run (12:00 UTC 2026-10-27).
- Test data: class HMJ8TW has several smoke-test workouts and one 4-star review.

## Next action
1. Ryan tries Go mode on his phone (wake lock, chime, share sheet, install).
2. Tier C: review history across days, per-day generation counts (the
   `workouts` table now makes this a query), whole-class workout mode.
